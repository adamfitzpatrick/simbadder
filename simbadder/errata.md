There is at least one entry (Entry for Sirius, bibliography code 2008A&A...492..199D, title "``Ultimate'' information content in solar and stellar spectra. Photospheric line asymmetries and wavelength shifts." (sic)) in which double

It does not appear that the wildcard id search actually functions as documented.
