The [SIMBAD Astronomical Database](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/) is one of the largest collections of astronomical
data in existence, boasting over 9 Million charted objects.  While the APIs offered by SIMBAD provide a broad set of
search functionality, responses are not generally available in an easily machine-parsed format.  Simbadder (yes, the name
is horrible) provides a wrapper around many of the SIMBAD search APIs, returning data in standard JSON format.
